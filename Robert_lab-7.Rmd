```{r}
library(tidyverse)

gc_df <- read_csv("gc_df.csv")
```


WE are asking: Is there a significant difference in recommended gun control action for male and female respondents (should guns be easier, harder, to get?)

This: I'm Nate and I'm updating this markdown file here. 

Robert: data wrangling and counts
```{r}
get_guns <- gc_df%>%
  filter(gender !="NA", make_get_guns !="NA") %>%
  count(gender, make_get_guns) %>%
  spread(make_get_guns, n) %>%
  select(-gender)

rownames(get_guns) <- c("Female","Male")

```
